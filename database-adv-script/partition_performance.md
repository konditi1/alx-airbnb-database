# Report on Query Performance: Partitioned vs. Non-Partitioned Table

## Objective
The goal of this analysis was to compare the performance of queries executed on a partitioned `Bookings` table and a non-partitioned `Booking_non_partitioned` table for filtering data within a specific date range (`2022-01-01` to `2022-12-31`).

## Observations

| **Table Type**         | **Execution Plan**                                                                 | **Actual Execution Time** |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Partitioned Table**   | - Filter: `(Bookings.start_date BETWEEN '2022-01-01' AND '2022-12-31')`.           | **0.0172 seconds**         |
|                         | - Table scan within relevant partitions only.                                     |                            |
| **Non-Partitioned Table** | - Filter: `(Booking_non_partitioned.start_date BETWEEN '2022-01-01' AND '2022-12-31')`. | **0.0103 seconds**         |
|                         | - Full table scan was performed, as no partitioning optimizations were available. |                            |

## Key Findings

### Partition Pruning:
- **Partitioned Table:**  
  MySQL limited the scan to the relevant partition(s) based on the `start_date`. This ensures that only a subset of the table is scanned, reducing I/O overhead for large datasets.
- While the dataset used in this analysis was small, the performance gain from partition pruning would be more evident with larger tables.

### Full Table Scan:
- **Non-Partitioned Table:**  
  Executed a full table scan, checking all rows even when filtering by `start_date`. This behavior would degrade performance as the table size grows.

### Execution Time:
- The observed execution time for the partitioned table was slightly **higher** than the non-partitioned table in this specific case (`0.0172s` vs. `0.0103s`).  
- The higher execution time is likely due to the dataset's small size, where the overhead of partition management outweighs pruning benefits.

## Conclusions

### Partitioning Benefits:
- For **large tables** with millions of rows, partitioning is expected to offer significant performance improvements, especially for queries filtering data by the partitioning key (e.g., `start_date`).
- Partition pruning reduces the number of rows scanned, leading to faster query execution for large datasets.

### Current Dataset:
- With a **small dataset**, the performance gain from partitioning is minimal. In fact, the added complexity of managing partitions may introduce slight overhead for queries.

## Recommendations
1. **Use Partitioning:**  
   - For very large tables where filtering by the partitioning key (e.g., `start_date`) is frequent.
2. **Indexing for Small Tables:**  
   - For smaller tables, index the filtering columns (e.g., `start_date`) instead of partitioning to avoid unnecessary complexity.
3. **Monitor Query Patterns:**  
   - Analyze real-world query patterns and table sizes to determine the optimal optimization strategy based on the application's requirements.
